# Introduction 
The owners of The General Putnam Motel Diner are creating an app that will allow their patrons to order their meals via a tablet placed on the tables at the restaurant.  As Corona caused the diner to close its doors to the public, this app will enable the Diners' customers to place takeout orders. 
This API provides a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate how one item on the menu (the Burger Meal) is ordered and received by the kitchen staff, and the responses the system generates once an order is received. Once this API is approved by the owners of The General Putnam Motel Diner, a new application will be created to include the entire menu.

# Errors 
The General Putnam Motel Diner API follows standard HTTP status codes for success or failure of an API call. 

|Status|	Code Description|
|------|---------|
200 - OK|	Your meal was successfully ordered.
400 - Bad Request|	Your order was unacceptable. The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. Most likely, you made unsupported additions to the meal request.
401 - Unauthorized	|The user must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
402 - Request Failed	|Your order was not received. Unstable Internet connection or a problem with the server is a likely cause.
